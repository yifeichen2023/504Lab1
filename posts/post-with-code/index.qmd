Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{python}
1+1
```
```{r}
# Load the pwr package
library(pwr)

# Define parameters
R_squared <- 0.775  # Example R^2 value
alpha <- 0.05      # Significance level
power <- 0.80      # Desired power
u <- 1             # Number of predictors (only one predictor)

# Convert R^2 to Cohen's f^2
f2 <- R_squared / (1 - R_squared)

# Perform power analysis
result <- pwr.f2.test(u = u, f2 = f2, sig.level = alpha, power = power)

# Extract the required sample size
# The function returns v (degrees of freedom for the denominator), so calculate sample size as:
n <- result$v + u + 1

# Print the result
cat("Required sample size:", n, "\n")
```


```{r}
# Define parameters
n <- 26 # Sample size (number of observations)
u <- 1                # Number of predictors (only one predictor in your case)
alpha <- 0.05         # Significance level

# Convert R-squared to Cohen's f^2
r_squared <- 0.775
f2 <- r_squared / (1 - r_squared)

# Perform power analysis
result <- pwr.f2.test(u = u, f2 = f2, sig.level = alpha, power = NULL, v = n - u - 1)

# Extract the power
power <- result$power
cat("Power of the analysis:", power, "\n")
