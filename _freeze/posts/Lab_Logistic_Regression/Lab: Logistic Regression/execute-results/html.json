Write short and informative commit messages, and share the link to your assignment with me. If not, you can also send me the **rmd** & **rendered file** via Canvas.\n\n    -   In this assignment, you will not need to code from scratch. Rather, you'll need to fill in code where needed. This assignment has a logisitic regression implementation for a scenario from EDA down to model comparison (and would be useful for whenever you may encounter such a situation in the future).\n\n    -   I want the assignments to begin reflecting a bit more of how you'd be doing things on your own, where you have some prior knowledge and you figure other things out (by referring to documentation, etc.) . In addition to the rmd, I also want you to submit to me **notes** of anything new that you learn while finishing the assignment. And any pain-points, and we'll discuss more.\n\n-   Note:\n\n    -   If you are fitting a model, display the model output in a neatly formatted table. (The `gt` `tidy` and `kable` functions can help!). `Modelsummary` also looks good(https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html)\n\n    -   Make sure that your plots are clearly labeled – for all axes, titles, etc.\\\n\n## Data: General Social Survey\n\nThe General Social Survey (GSS) has been used to measure trends in attitudes and behaviors in American society since 1972. In addition to collecting demographic information, the survey includes questions used to gauge attitudes about government spending priorities, confidence in institutions, lifestyle, and many other topics. A full description of the survey may be found here.\n\nThe data for this lab are from the 2016 General Social Survey. The original data set contains 2867 observations and 935 variables. We will use and abbreviated data set that includes the following variables:\n\nnatmass: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n\n“We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. I’m going to name some of these problems, and for each one I’d like you to tell me whether you think we’re spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the right amount…are we spending too much, too little, or about the right amount on mass transportation?”\n\nage: Age in years.\n\nsex: Sex recorded as male or female\n\nsei10: Socioeconomic index from 0 to 100\n\nregion: Region where interview took place\n\npolviews: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n\n“We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I’m going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal - point 1 - to extremely conservative - point 7. Where would you place yourself on this scale?”\n\nThe data are in gss2016.csv in the data folder.\n\n## EDA\n\n> Let’s begin by making a binary variable for respondents’ views on spending on mass transportation. Create a new variable that is equal to “1” if a respondent said spending on mass transportation is about right and “0” otherwise.

This indicates that females are, on average, about 6.6 percentage points more likely than males to be satisfied with mass transportation spending, holding other factors constant.\n\n## Model comparison\n\n-   Now let’s see whether a person’s political views has a significant impact on their odds of being satisfied with spending on mass transportation, after accounting for the demographic factors.\n\n> Conduct a drop-in-deviance/likelihood ratio test to determine if polviews is a significant predictor of attitude towards spending on mass transportation. Name these two models `fit2` and `fit3`, respectively. Compare the two models.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit2 <- glm(mass_trans_spend_right ~ sex + age + sei10, \n            data = data, \n            family = binomial())\n\nfit3 <- glm(mass_trans_spend_right ~ sex + age + sei10 + polviews, \n            data = data, \n            family = binomial())\n\ntest_likelihoodratio(fit2, fit3) %>% kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|     |Name |Model | df| df_diff|     Chi2|  p|\n|:----|:----|:-----|--:|-------:|--------:|--:|\n|fit2 |fit2 |glm   |  4|      NA|       NA| NA|\n|fit3 |fit3 |glm   | 10|       6| 63.02844|  0|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n> Is the model with polviews better than the model without?\n\n-   Yes.\n\n## Visualization\n\n-   Let’s plot the results\n\n-   We next use the model to produce visualizations:\n\n    -   Given the code below, interpet what is being plotted:\n\n        -   pol_plot : \\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n        -   sex_plot : \\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n        -   ses_plot: \\_\\_\\_\n\n    ::: callout-tip\n    -   adjust the various settings in your plot to make it look professional.\n\n    -   You can use `ggeffects` to get the predicted probabilities for these models.\n    :::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggeffects)\n\n\ncolors <- c(\"Extremely liberal\" = \"black\",\n            \"Liberal\" = \"#0e2f44\",  # Dark blue\n            \"Slightly liberal\" = \"#1d5a6c\",  # Less dark blue\n            \"Moderate\" = \"#358ca3\",  # Medium blue\n            \"Slghtly conservative\" = \"#71b9d1\",  # Light blue\n            \"Conservative\" = \"#a6dcef\",  # Lighter blue\n            \"Extrmly conservative\" = \"#d0f0fd\")  # Very light blue\n\npp_pol <- ggemmeans(fit3, terms = c(\"polviews\"))\n\n# Adjusted plot with gradient colors\npol_plot <- ggplot(pp_pol, aes(x = x, y = predicted, color = x)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0.2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +\n  labs(title = \"Effect of Political Views on Satisfaction with Mass Transportation\",\n       x = \"Political Views\", y = \"Predicted Probability\",\n       color = \"Political Views\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\npol_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab--Logistic-Regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npp_sex <- ggemmeans(fit3, terms = c(\"sex\"))\n\nsex_plot <- ggplot(pp_sex, aes(x = x, y = predicted, color = x)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Effect of Sex on Satisfaction with Mass Transportation\",\n       x = \"Sex\", y = \"Predicted Probability\",\n       color = \"Sex\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\npp_sex\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# Predicted probabilities of mass_trans_spend_right\n\nsex    | Predicted |     95% CI\n-------------------------------\nMale   |      0.48 | 0.44, 0.51\nFemale |      0.55 | 0.51, 0.58\n\nAdjusted for:\n*   age = 48.90\n* sei10 = 46.07\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npp_ses <- ggemmeans(fit3, terms = \"sei10\")\n\n\nses_plot <-  ggplot(pp_ses, aes(x = x, y = predicted)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#2c7fb8\", size = 1) + \n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), fill = \"#2c7fb8\", alpha = 0.2) +  # Add a confidence interval band\n  labs(title = \"Effect of SES on Satisfaction with Mass Transportation\",\n       x = \"Socioeconomic Status\", y = \"Predicted Probability\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  \nses_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab--Logistic-Regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-2.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Model Assumptions\n\n-   Is the logistic model a good choice for this data?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbinned_residuals(fit2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nWarning: About 86% of the residuals are inside the error bounds (~95% or higher would be good).\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\nAnswer: It is below 95%, so not really a good choice.\n:::\n\n## Model fit\n\n-   Calculate the $R^2$ for this model\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nr2_mcfadden(fit2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# R2 for Generalized Linear Regression\n       R2: 0.010\n  adj.
